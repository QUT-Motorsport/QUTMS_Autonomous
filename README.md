# QUTMS autonomous system - WIP
This repo aims the explain and document our development of autonomus driverless system. 

__WORK IN PROGRESS__ 

## How to use
The top directory (root) of this repo is just under Gazebo's models folder.
Given a properly installed ROS (melodic), these files are to be placed __in__ `~/.gazebo/models/`.
This will allow Gazebo to find our models in its database.

## Catkin workspace
A ROS catkin_ws is required to run the simulation. See our [QUTMS_catkin_ws](https://github.com/QUT-Motorsport/QUTMS_catkin_ws) repo for details.
