# QUTMS autonomous system - WIP
This repo aims the explain and document our development of autonomus driverless system. 

__WORK IN PROGRESS__ 

## How to use
The top directory of this repe contains `model.sdf` and `model.config`.
Given a properly installed ROS (melodic), these files are to be placed in `~/.gazebo/models/QEV2/`.    
This allows Gazebo to find the model in its database.

## catkin_ws-DO_NOT_USE
This folder is now here for quick reference - despite its incapability to plug-and-play. 

To run Gazebo with ROS, a catkin workspace is required in a separate location of your machine. 

Another README is in `catkin_ws-DO_NOT_USE` folder.
Please read carefully before using, otherwise things will likely break.
