# QUTMS autonomous system - WIP
This repo aims the explain and document our development of autonomus driverless system. 

__WORK IN PROGRESS__ 

## How to use
The top directory of this repe contains `model.sdf` and `model.config`.
Given a properly installed ROS (melodic), these files are to be placed in `~/.gazebo/models/QEV2/`.    
This allows Gazebo to find the model in its database.

## QUTMS_catkin_ws
This is a submodule of another repo. 
It is added here for the time being to centralise our development process. 

For more details, read QUTMS_catkin_ws's README.
